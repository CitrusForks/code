# code
some code i made

Includes a one project visual studio solution (using toolset v120). The project
serves me as a framework for protopyping ideas, however it got a bit spoiled
By the "black" - protopype of a story game which kind of fails and, to worse,
grew into some parts of the "engine" part. Never the less it works as a starting
point for simple dx11 apps. To earn more understanding of systems working underneath,
I avoided using external libraries, and stayed only with dx11 and sony's vectormath.
Everything should compile and run right of the bat, and it requres only directx sdk
(I use probably the last version before it got merged into windows SDK) and I put into
repository vectormath files taken from the bullet engine.

If you found this project and have questions about it write to me: mare85mare@gmail.com.
